This directory contains all files related to IP Reputation inspection.

Reputation inspector provides basic IP blocklist/allowlist capabilities, to
block/drop/pass traffic from IP addresses listed. In the past, we use standard
Snort rules to implement Reputation-based IP blocking. This inspector will
address the performance issue and make the IP reputation management easier.

This inspector also supports interfaces through manifest files. You can specify an 
action (BLOCK, ALLOW, MONITOR) for an IP list with interfaces. The name of manifest 
file is interface.info. For each line of the manifest file, the format is:

  file_name, list_id, action (block, allow, monitor), [interface information]

If interface information is empty, this means all interfaces are applied
